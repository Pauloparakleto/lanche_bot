#  Lanche Bot

There is a nice restaurant on my neighborhood. I friend of mine works there as the receptionist listening on many delivery channels as possible.

Lanche bot is a bot for whatsapp made with rails framework and consuming a Twilio API.
This prototype simulates a talk I used to have with the receptionist when I ask the same food always.

## Give to it a try

Ask the Twilio number for this project in private to this repository owner. After this I'll give you the password to initialize the lanche bot.

It is in portuguese so...

Things you may initially ask:

1. "Fala", to initialize the talk;
2. "Qual lanche que tem hoje?" or "Me manda o menu";
3. "De que que tem o suco?";
4. "Quanto que t√° o x bacon?

The customization is been according to Everton concerns.
